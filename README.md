# HTML/CSS/JS project

Includes Gulp to compile Scss into CSS, along with Autoprefixer and Browser Sync.

## Setup

Before starting, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and yarn(https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Clone this repo to your local computer using this command:

    git clone https://github.com/donSan4o/uonline.git

With the files downloaded, navigate to your `kuril` folder on the command line (or Terminal) and run `jarn` to set things up.

With this set up, you should now be able to run:

    gulp default

This will process any SCSS files and launch a web browser showing the current files. Making changes to the files should result in the page updating automatically.
